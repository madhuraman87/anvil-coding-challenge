# Anvil Coding Takehome
Hello 👋 & welcome to the anvil coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems, not for us to test magic keyword knowledge of our tech stack. If you're having build issues 🔧 with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## How it works

* You will get an email from one of us with the specific task to complete
* Fork this repo into your own account
* Make a new branch
* When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
* We will take a look at your solution, then talk through your solution during your interview

## Getting the project running

```bash
# Fork this project, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/...

cd anvil-coding-challenge

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Run the linter, server tests, and client tests
yarn test
```

Other helpful things

```bash
yarn lint # Only the linter
yarn test:server # Only the server tests
yarn test:client # Only the client tests

yarn db:reset # Reset the DB to the initial seed data
```

## What even is it?

It's a single page app that shows a list of files.

You can add new files!

That's all it does without your help!

## Task
1) Search/Filter
- Add a search box to the top of the list of files. 
- The list of files should filter as you type
- A query param should update as you type. e.g. localhost:3000/?q=elvis
- Navigating to the page with a query param should search the file list on load

2) Filename De-duplication
- The coding challenge application allows you to upload multiple files with the same filename. The goal is to fix this. When someone uploads a file with a duplicate filename in the DB, rewrite the new filename to a filename with a unique identifier.
  - If unicorns.png is uploaded and it already exists in the database, it should rewrite to unicorns(1).png. 
  - It should count up and fill any gaps. e.g. unicorns.png is uploaded and [‘unicorns.png’, ‘unicorns(1).png’, ‘unicorns(3).png’, ‘unicorns(5).png’] exist, the next names would contain (2), (4), (6), (7), etc.
  - Shoot for simplicity, the main goal is just that there are no dupes in the db!
